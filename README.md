# Grocery-Tracking-Program
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Grocery-Tracking Program is designed to track the frequency of items in a grocery list and provide various options for data analysis and visualization. Here is a description of the code's design and           functionality. The program consists of several files organized as follows: 
data_processing.h and data_processing.cpp: These files contain functions responsible for processing the data and backing up the file. 
menu_navigation.h and menu_navigation.cpp: These files handle the menu navigation and user interaction. 
Itemtracker.h and Itemtracker.cpp: These files define the Itemtracker class, which manages the tracking and analysis of item frequencies. 
main.cpp: This is the main file that integrates the functionality of the other files and serves as the entry point of the program.
Note to the user:  in order to run the program, you can use the given input file name: CS_Input_File.txt. The program will not start unless a file that exists in the same directory as the program is given.

1. What did you do particularly well?
I believe I implemented industry best practices, including proper naming conventions, comments, and error handling, to ensure readability, maintainability, and reliability.

2. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
At this moment I believe my code is efficient and secure. But I do fine myself looking back at my past coding projects and noticing areas where I could have made improvements to make my code more efficient, secure, and so on.

3. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Implementing a class to the code was probably the most challenging part for me. At first, I coded the whole program using only functions, the functions had their own files, and were organized and clean. After reviewing the project requirements over again I noticed that the project called for at least one class. I then went back to my code and had to rethink the whole program over again, fortunately I was able to implement a class that created a list from the input file and used getters and setters to present the information to the user, and all this without dramatically changing existing code. 

4. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The project employs C++ features such as classes, functions, file I/O, and user input/output to provide a robust and interactive experience. These features are common with many other languages such as java and python. The code follows best practices, including proper naming conventions, comments, and error handling, to ensure readability, maintainability, and reliability. Most if not all of these practices are universal through out the  coding community, and understanding and putting them in to practice  will help me with my future projects going Forword.

5. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
The program uses Object-oriented programming principles, these are applied through the use of classes and separate files for different functionalities, which in turn make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
